				<p id="about-text">Hello! I'm a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley studying computer science.</p>
				<p id="about-text">I'm currently interning in Housing Development Board of Singapore, performing data analytics and setting up a SAS VA dashboard. I have also completed a previous internship with the UIUX team in HDB, designing webpages and public online e-services. </p>
				<p id="about-text">I am very grateful to be in exciting clubs in Berkeley such as Mobile Developers of Berkeley and Codeology. In MDB, together as a team of 3, we designed and created Courtroom, a full stack mobile application. Courtroom aims to better connect underpriviledge communities with pro-bono lawyers and public defenders. In Codeology, I was excited to explore Game Engines and created basic games such as Snake and Osu. </p>
				<p id="about-text">In my free time, I like to exercise - gym, sports, runs and hikes. The gym is my go-to place in order to relieve stress, the physique is an added bonus. I also enjoy reading manga, watching anime and netflix. </p>
